# SENG440_RSA

A Project that does 64-bit RSA encryption. 

This code is for the Software Engineering 440 Course at the University of Victoria. 
This is not a cryptographically secure implementation of RSA to be used by real people. 
This project is meant to demonstrate embedded systems software optimizations, such as
implementing [Montgomery modular multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_modular_multiplication), 
compiling with optimizing flags, and other clever optimizations to run on low-power hardware.
